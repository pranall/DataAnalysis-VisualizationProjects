# Data Visualizations On Dashboards

## **Project Summary**

This project focuses on creating two **static dashboard reports** using the **Arizona’s Air Quality** dataset to evaluate air quality trends in Arizona. The dashboards are static visualizations, not interactive.

The dashboards highlight:

* **Positive Dashboard:** Seasons or periods with good air quality and beneficial actions.
* **Negative Dashboard:** Seasons or periods with poor air quality and detrimental conditions to avoid.

The goal is to summarize trends, convey insights clearly, and guide actionable decisions.

---

## **1. Positive Dashboard**

* Highlights periods with good air quality.
* Shows beneficial KPIs, such as low particulate matter concentrations and favorable seasonal trends.
* Graphics designed for clarity, with legible fonts, informative axes, and no data artifacts.
* Layout and color usage chosen to reflect positive outcomes and semantic resonance with air quality improvements.
* Captions and annotations describe trends and data decisions clearly.

---

## **2. Negative Dashboard**

* Highlights periods with poor air quality.
* Displays detrimental KPIs, such as high particulate matter concentrations or problematic seasonal trends.
* Graphics use the same style and layout as the positive dashboard but emphasize negative outcomes through color, labels, and annotations.
* No data artifacts, legible text, and informative axis labels.
* Captions explain trends and highlight conditions to avoid.

## **3. Data Accuracy and Manipulation**

* Data cleaning and manipulation preserve key trends without over-filtering.
* Summaries accurately represent seasonal changes and daily air quality metrics.
* Aggregation and binning applied where necessary to display temporal patterns effectively.

---

## **4. Layout and Design**

* Dashboard layouts prioritize eye flow, readability, and gestalt principles.
* Colors semantically reinforce positive or negative traits in the respective dashboards.
* Graphics arranged to communicate a coherent narrative and support the KPIs highlighted.

---

## **5. Reproducibility**

* Python code for data processing and visualization is fully included.
* .ipynb file contains Positive Dashboard first, Negative Dashboard second, followed by the code.
