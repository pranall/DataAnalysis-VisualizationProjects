# DataAnalysis-VisualizationProjects
Hi, these are all the projects I did in Data Analysis and Visualization in Python.

-------

**Data MAnipulation and Basic Plots:** Processed the Urban Park Rangers dataset to analyze changes over time in animal assistance requests. Filtered and reshaped relevant columns into an importable table, calculated trends, and exported outputs to separate sheets. Consolidated findings into a publication table with informative captions

**Plots, Flowcharts and Cognitive Load:** This project focuses on creating a Pretty Plot and an Ugly Plot using the Maricopa Covid19 dataset. Created a pulishable pretty plot and a non publishable Ugly plot and gave more insights on how to make visualization legible.

**Advanced Plots and Illusions:** This project focuses on creating a Pretty Plot and an Illusion Plot using the Slugs and Snails dataset. Created a pulishable pretty plot and a non publishable Illusion plot and gave more insights on how to make visualization legible.

**Data Visualization for Clustering and PCA:** This project involves performing a Cluster Analysis and a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on the Angry Birds (Cardinal Personalities).xlsx dataset. The dataset models personality types of northern cardinals from different environments, with three predefined personality groups.

**Data Visualizations On Dashboards:** This project focuses on creating two static dashboard reports using the Arizona’s Air Quality dataset to evaluate air quality trends in Arizona. The dashboards are static visualizations, not interactive.
