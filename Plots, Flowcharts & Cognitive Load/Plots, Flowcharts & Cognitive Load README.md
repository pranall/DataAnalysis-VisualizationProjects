# **Plots, Flowcharts and Cognitive Load**

Produced two publication-ready graphics and accompanying reproducible code for Maricopa County COVID vaccination data (June 2021–Feb 2022). The submission included a single PDF with the pretty plot first, the ugly plot second, and the data-manipulation code third.

Details:
• Data processed and cleaned for CSV ingestion, including removal of punctuation from variable names, consolidation of postal-code-level data to county-level summaries, and creation of age-group and time-series aggregates.
• Assignment used the Maricopa Covid19 dataset, which reports COVID vaccinations by age group and postal code from June 2021 to February 2022, to answer two questions: comparison of vaccination totals between age groups and trends in average vaccination totals over time.
• Pretty plot answered both questions in one graphic, with an informative caption documenting filtering decisions, aggregation steps, and formatting choices.
• Pretty plot used legible fonts, appropriate sizing, clear labels, consistent color mapping, correct scaling, and no data artifacts.
• Pretty plot exported at publication-quality resolution.
• Ugly plot answered the same questions while intentionally including at least five display errors such as improper scaling, poor font selection, misleading colors, inappropriate plot type, and a flawed caption.
• Both plots followed the allowed plot-type constraints and used captions placed as text beneath each plot.
• Code and data-preparation steps were fully reproducible and matched the outputs shown.
